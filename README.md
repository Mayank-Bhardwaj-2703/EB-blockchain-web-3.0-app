Web App to Implement Electoral Bonds Transactions Using Blockchain Technology.


## ABSTRACT
To Implement Electoral Bonds Transactions Using Blockchain Technology. A blockchain stores
information electronically in digital format and maintain a secure and decentralized record of
transactions. It will also guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust
without the need for a trusted third party.

## OVERVIEW
PRIOR TO ELECTORAL BONDS, POLITICAL PARTIES HAD TO MAINTAIN RECORDS OF
DONATIONS ABOVE ₹20,000.
THE GOVERNMENT HAD INTRODUCED THE ELECTORAL BONDS SCHEME WITH THE
PROMISE OF BRINGING IN TRANSPARENCY IN POLITICAL FUNDING.
HOWEVER, MANY POLITICAL EXPERTS ARE OF THE OPINION THAT ELECTORAL BONDS
IN THEIR DESIGN AND OPERATION, ALLOW FOR LIMITLESS AND ANONYMOUS
CORPORATE DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES.

###	ELECTORAL BONDS using block chain

Blockchain is becoming an important new feature, with many different operating cases. While distributed applications, for example, text sharing has been around since the days the Web became the foundation of our lives, their use in secure and consistent trading goes back to 2008. Since then, with the rise of Bitcoin, individuals and organizations have become increasingly aware of the benefits that blockchain innovation offers.
One of the newest but most inspiring blockchain applications is in the Electoral bonds. In the normal course of events, electoral bonds will eventually become standard. Electronic trading techniques will improve the political race process by making it faster and more straightforward. Like many experts in this field, electoral bonding with political parties requires advanced security measures, which can only be provided by blockchain technology with its own distribution environment..

The main advantages of a blockchain technology for electoral bonding are:
⦁	Transparency
⦁	Security
⦁	Anonymity
⦁	Processing time

⦁ With the help of Blockchain technology we were able to develop Electoral
  bond web-application on Ethereum blockchain through which transactions
  can be done and stored on a database which can be verified using Etherscan .
